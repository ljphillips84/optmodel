To use fitting script run "main.py" using python 2.7.

Make sure that all acommpanying files/folders are in the same directory.

Please be warned, these scripts were not intended for public consumption.
They have come straight from my brain without comments.  
I wrote them a couple of years ago and even I don't know what half of it means.

You will need numpy, scipy and matplotlib packages installed to run the script.

FILES LIST:
-------------------------------------

11.txt, 21.txt, 44.txt - test data<br>
Calcs21.py - fitting algorithms<br>
Model.py - dielectric model<br>
OW.txt - substrate refractive index/extinction coefficient<br>
main.py - main script: RUN THIS<br>
models1.py - dielectric model<br>



Any questions, please don't hesitate to contact me.

I think it's about time I re-wrote this code.
